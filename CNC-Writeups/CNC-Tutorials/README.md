These libraries will contain an assortment of bit, each will have their physical properties, opertaion type, and a simplified bit model stored within them.

The bits also store the manufacturer recommended Feeds and Speeds data stored in them as 'Presets'.

Some bits might have multiple presets stored in them for different situations. Such as, for different materials, different types of operations, etc.

Be careful and remember to check your presets for each operation! Its not fun breaking bits. D:
