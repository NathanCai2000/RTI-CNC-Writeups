# Material Restrictions and Dangers:

## Allowed Materials:
This is a list of materials for which we have either a ready made template avaible for, or a maching profile in openly avalible for bits and machines currently in use (Carbide 3D presets). 

> - UHMW (<= 2in Thickness)
> - HDPE (<= 2in Thickness)
> - Nylon (<= 0.25in Thickness)
> - ABS (<= 0.25in Thickness)
> - Acrylic (<= 0.25in Thickness)
> - Polycarbonate (<= 0.25in Thickness)
> - Aluminum 6061 (<= 0.25in Thickness)
> - Wax (Within Workarea Fit)
> - Plywood (<= 1in Thickness)
> - MDF (<= 1in Thickness)
> - Balsa Wood (<= 1in Thickness)
> - Cardboard (<= 0.25in Thickness)

## Restricted Materials:
Materials listed here are currently not openly avalible to be used on the CNC. Reasons can vary from a lack of a tested cutting profile to material hazards as a result of cutting. REasons for each restriction is denoted for each. ```These materials are generally restricted, however, is allowed to be cut or tested on to the disgression and supervision from an RTI Staff Memeber.```

### Steel Alloys:
> Though the machinability of Steels vary depending on the Alloys and their properties, compared to other metals and materials, steel places to most tension
