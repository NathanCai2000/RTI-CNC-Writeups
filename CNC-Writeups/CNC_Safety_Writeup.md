# CNC and Workshop Tools Rules

### Machine Room Restrictions and Rules:
1. Dress Code:
> - All long hair, loose accessories, and loose clothing should be tied and out of the way.
> - Scarves, long sleeve shirts must be secured tight, rolled up and secured, or taken off before use of the machines.
> - No Gloves are allowed.
> - Necklaces, braces, or any other jewelry must be tucked away or taken off before use.
> - No Open-Toed Shoes are allowed.
> - No Nail Extensions or Hand-ware allowed.
2.  Don’t use the machines if you are tired
3. Wear hearing protection when the shop is loud
4. All uses of the machine room must be scheduled beforehand, you may not use any tools in the machine room unless you have scheduled a time.
5. Any use of the machines or workshop tools must be scheduled 48 Hours ahead of the time of use.
6. The scheduled blocks should include the time needed to set up the machine and the time needed to clean up after the operations.
> -  Be sure to account for the setup and the cleanup time. 
> -  You are expected to know the total time it will take to complete your operations.
> -  Include extra time in case your operations fail and you need to restart the machine.
7. Stop all operations and clean up before your scheduled time runs out
8. Remove Chips with brushes or the shop vacuum, not with your hands or compressed air.
9. Only start the machines when your scheduled time has begun
10. Do not remove or damage machine guards
11. Only people vetted and approved by Tim or Ian are allowed to use the machines in the Machine Room.
12. Only use machines you are trained to use and only use the machines you have specified in your scheduled block.
13. When using any Workshop Tools or the CNC, a second person must also be present in the room. 
> - Both people must both be vetted and trained in the use of the machines you are planning to use.
> - If the other person is not trained to use a tool, you are not allowed to use it until someone else trained in the tool is present.
> - You are allowed to have an RTI Staff member present in a video to act as the second person.
> -They must be able to see you and the machine in the video call to count to the rule.
> - Only one machine can be operated simultaneously at a time.
> - Only the machines you have scheduled can be used during your time block.
14. Only two people are allowed in the room at a time while a machine is being used, and only those who have scheduled to use the machines.
Keep your hands clear of the machine’s area of operation; if you need to handle something in the area, pause the machine.
15. The room will have a 1 strike rule, failure to abide by the rules will result in both individuals losing their access to the room.
16. You are only permitted to cut files on the CNC that you have personally seen and have personally reviewed the CAM for.
17. You are only allowed to cut materials RTI has profiles for.
18. Ensure all workpieces are Secured Properly.
19. All machines can launch parts at dangerous speeds if not secured properly.
> - Be sure that there is proper ventilation and debris collection during use.
20. Some materials produce Toxic or Cancerous materials when cut.
> - If a machine breaks, stop using it, turn it off, and notify an RTI staff member.


# Understanding the Rules:
1. All the machines use exposed high-powered spinning parts that rotate at thousands of RPMs. Hair, sleeves, scarves, or any object can be caught and sucked into the spinning components of the machines. Gloves in particular are prohibited due to the chances of them being caught in a machine and dragging the wearer in.
2. The Machine Room is filled with many dangerous tools in exposed areas, attentiveness and awareness of your surroundings are needed in order to work safely.
3. The machines in the room are loud and can cause hearing damage.
4. To avoid crowding and also to avoid a queue of CNC machine use.
5. To ensure ample notice for all students, staff, and RTI staff members.
6. To ensure the safety and efficient use of the CNC, some overhead is needed for preparing the CNC for operation, setting up workpieces, readjustments due to cut failures, and cleaning the CNC after use.
7. Ensure everyone has efficient access to the CNC and so no dangerous debris is left in the CNC after use.
8. The chips produced by the CNC often are sharp and hot, and there is a risk of being cut or burnt. Compressed air shouldn’t be used as the CNC also often produces fine powder during the cutting process, which is a respiratory hazard.
9. Ensure that RTI and someone knows where someone is aware of the happenings in the machine room so that proper services can be notified in case of an accident or emergency.
10. The guards are there to help protect or prevent users from being harmed or to mitigate the potential injuries during a malfunction.
11. To ensure the safety of the person using the tools and also to ensure someone does not damage the tool, endangering themselves or others who use the tool later on.
12. Please refer to the explanation for rule #7
13. Having a second person ensures that when someone has an issue or if there is an accident, there is someone else to help.
> - This is to ensure that a second person is there to help check your work or help in an emergency.
> - Same Reason as #13.a
> - Due to potential scheduling issues with arranging times with other students, this option exists to allow more accessibility to the machines. > The main goal of the two-person system is to have more confirmation that proper safety is being exercised and rapid response to emergencies. > These points can all be achieved over a video call, however, to further ensure vigilance this is only accessible to be done with RTI staff.
> - Due to the danger of the machines, to ensure safe use of them, one’s focus should only be allocated to one machine at a time.
> - To help keep records of who has used which machine and to be aware of the potential during use, machines should be used individually and given their own time overheads for safety.
14. Due to the size of the machine room and the hands-on nature of the machines, too many people in the room can pose a safety risk, due to bumping or distractions.
15. Even if the path of the CNC is known, it is best to be safe and pause the machine to fix the issue. If the situation requires that you physically need to handle the workpiece, the issue is big enough to warrant pausing the machine.
16. The tools are dangerous and student even being allowed to access these kinds of tools is a privilege given to us by Brandeis University. If a single major accident occurs with any of the tools, the whole RTI program and its rooms all get shut down permanently.  Hurting yourself is hurting everyone else, and demonstrating a lack of consideration for the rules is demonstrating a lack of care for the safety of others and their right to have access to these tools.
17. Even if you trust the person who has given you the file, not knowing the exact paths of the CAM can be catastrophic, both in safety and in damage to the machine. CNCs adhere perfectly to the instructions given, thus situations such as the workpiece being defined in CAM as being bigger than the real-world CNC work area and the CNC running against the wall is a possibility, if not inspected for in code.
18. Some materials you cut will produce toxic and dangerous gases or particles when cut. Carbon Fiber creates sharp micro-particles that are cancerous and will damage your lungs when inhaled, so it needs to be fully submerged in water when being cut. PVC will produce Chlorine Gas (ie Mustard Gas) when cut or burned, so proper ventilation is needed to not cause injury.
19. The CNC and workshop tools often operate at high RPMs, if workpieces are not properly secured, there is a chance of the machine throwing the object and high speeds.
20. These machines are dangerous when operating normally, and the dangers grow if there is an issue. This is also to ensure the longevity of the machines.
